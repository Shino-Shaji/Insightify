0,"3 Months into use everyday, worth a purchase",ANUJ GUPTA,"I have been using these industry leading headphones by Sony, colour Midnight Blue, and trust me i find them worth every penny spent. Yes, i agree these headphones are highly expensive, some may say you can purchase Apple Airpods, Boss, Sennheiser, and other audio equipment options, but trust me nothing beats these bad boys.I am not a tech reviewer, but since being a musician, a music connoisseur myself and a huge fanatic of accessories such as headphones, earphones and smart gadgets, i can tell, these headphones are a revolution to the sound industry. I'll be quoting every pros and cons that i've personally come across and might help a few of you who decide to purchase this beauty.Pros:1. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): Let's talk about people who love listening to their music without any external interference while working, walking, running, working out, during a flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, ANC is a boon. Switch to ANC, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. Only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. Be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that ANC kicked in.2. 3 Ambience Sound Control (ASC) ON: Apart from the ANC, there are two more features that these bad boys offer.  ASC when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. This feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.3. Ambience Sound Control (ASC) OFF: When ASC is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the ASC is enabled. This feature is much similar to the ASC ON, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.4. Head Phones Connect by Sony: Let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by Sony under the name of Head Phones Connect. You can download it from the App store if you are an iPhone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.This app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. Once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.In addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.One feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the Speak-to-chat feature. It's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. This feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.For better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. This enables the device to perform better with distinct users.5. Motion Gestures: The right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. These controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.6. Number of devices that can be paired at once: These headphones provide an option of connecting two devices simultaneously. You can connect these headphones to almost every device that has a latest and updated version of bluetooth/NFC. Devices that i've paired them with are iPhone, macbook, hp laptop, and android phones.7. What's in the box: The box comes with an impressive in-shape carrying case to carry these bad boys where ever you go. Also they include a C-type data cable for charging, 3.5mm jack cable which is quite long (haven't measured it honestly, but it is as long as a regular data cable), and a dual port 3.5mm jack converter, which so far i haven't tested.8. Battery Life: Well i must say that i am quite impressed with the battery backup these headphones provide. This device completely charges within 3 hours and trust me with an ON/OFF mode of playing music regularly, the battery stays up till 4-5 days, which is i bet a highly impressive feature which probably no other company audio equipment in this range might have.9. Voice Assist Functions: These headphones can be connected to google assistant, SIRI and alexa and perform really well.10. Easy access keys: The headphones are enable with two easy access keys on the left earphone. The custom key toggles between the 3 modes that i've already mentioned above which are guided by the in-built assistant voice. The power key pressed long enough, turns ON/OFF the device and pressed once, the in-built assist provides you with the current % of the battery left.11. Comfort: I should had talked about it earlier, but never mind. With no questions asked these headphones are highly comfortable, the cushion provided is the softest pad your ears can get. Since i am regular spectacle user, i find it hard with headphones imposing excessive pressure over the ears, making it a painful experience, but these headphones give a feather touch to your ears, even if you are specy or even while wearing a face mask. These go good with everything.12. Battery Saver: These headphones tend to power-off on their own if not in use for more than a minute which is a highly power efficient feature added by Sony to the device.Cons:1. If you are into running or any sort of longer workouts, be prepared for sweaty ears. Since the cushions on these headphones completely cover you ears, creating a vacuum sort of environment, no air flows in and out, and the sweat starts dripping down from the earphones, which i must state doesn't affect them at all, only can be slightly irritating sometimes.2. ANC can be difficult to be kept enabled every time since it reduces the environment sounds to almost negligible, which can be dangerous while running or walking at a buss street. Be very careful while using this feature. Probably it is made for environments such as while travelling in a bus or a flight, and seems suitable for these environments.3. Since these headphones can be simultaneously be connected to two devices at once, which is a boon, but is also a slight problem in disguise. Imagine your headphones are connected with your laptop as well as you phone. You are attending an important zoom call while on your laptop and the headphones are in action, your phone starts to ring, now abruptly you'll start hearing you phones ringtone, and the device gets a little startled to which device shall be entertained. i've personally faced this, but i tend not to connect them to two devices at once.PS: One highly important thing is, you won't get an experience of the sound through reading review or watching Youtube videos. You might get a fair image of weather to invest in them or not, but you'll only get the sound experience when you'll listen the music through these bad boys.",5.0,22 May 2022,376
1,"Top notch ANC, great battery life, good audio quality and poor mic",theNinja,"Audio Quality is great. These headphones sound amazing but the problem is they're tuned out of the box. It doesn't feel like they product neutral sound like many other headphones. But this is fine, you can always adjust the EQ, and Sony's tuning isn't bad (it'll satisfy most users).Mic quality is pretty bad. I don't understand how such an expensive has poor mic quality. It sounds like a mic from a cheap TWS earbud. This headphone isn't for calls or meetings. The mic quality is only a part of the problem. It doesn't have a sidetone feature. You can't hear yourself talking while in a call. Trust  me, you don't used to this (you shouldn't). It feels weird and in most cases, you'll end up talking louder than you should, just to satisfy your brain.I use multi-point connectivity. I can keep the headphone connected to phone and PC at the same time. When I receive a call on a device, it automatically switches to that device. I wish the call experience on this headphone was better.Battery life is great as expected. It lasts days for my usage. It lasts even longer when I turn off ANC.It's also very comfortable to wear this headset.I also like it that you can just fold the headset and place it on the table. It takes less space and doesn't need a stand. The carry case is also nice.The cables Sony provides with the headset are really short. I don't know why a billion dollar company like Sony does this with their expensive product lineup.One of the things I really liked about this headphones is that Sony's app doesn't require you to create an account and grant it permission to everything on the phone like some other brands. Connecting and configuring the headphone is also easy. The app has poor UX but it gets the job done. You probably don't need to visit the app very often.",5.0,14 April 2024,0
2,Decent Quality,Santosh S.,"Pros:* Feels like a premium product, packaging and the provided carry pouch are perfect, aux cable is a plus, charging cable could have been longer* Very comfortable to wear over workouts, etc.* Connects instantly on my iPhone 13 after you turn on the product* Bluetooth reach is good* Sound is balanced with not too much overpowering bass... overall good enough for gym goers.* Noise isolation is really great* App for connection is simple enough and gives you customizing options...Cons* Build quality although decent still does not feel like a premium product costing 20k plus, a few metal bits here and there would have made it possible* Not for true audiophiles.. more a competition of beats by dr dreAll in all, if you get a good deal during some festival go for it.. DO NOT BUY IT AT FULL PRICE!",4.0,29 January 2024,10
3,Better than Many TWS at this price range!,Tanuj Singh,"I know there is no point comparing TWS like AirPods pro to these headphones as they both are very different but most buyers might have a fixed budget like me in which they could either go for some good TWS or Headphones.I was first leaning towards AirPods pro 2 but later on changed my mind because -1. AirPods have a fixed battery life (not taking about discharge timing), your Airpods might only last for couple of years when you will start noticing a significant degradation in battery health. Moreover, it will end up in landfill as you can’t get its battery replaced. On the other hand, In headphones like these you can get the battery replaced and moreover you can use them in ‘wired mode’ (AUX cable included) without a battery!2. Bigger drivers = more vivid sound, I am not an Audiophile but in my experience and usage I have felt that the headphones generally produce a more pleasing sound. (it could be a personal preference)Pros about XM4 -1. Good built quality, soft to touch but still rigid at the same time.2. Very comfortable for long listening sessions.3. Multi device connectivity, you can simultaneously connect it to two devices! That in my opinion is a must feature in a premium headphone. You would just need to install the proprietary application in one device and connect the headphones to any secondary device using the app, after that you can control the volume, eq and much more from your primary device (using the app). Device switching is also very smooth.4. Noise cancellation and transparency mode is also very good, keeping in mind the various modes you could choose from the app according to your liking.5. Battery life, I have to never worry about the battery life as it could last for days with heavy use and above that you can put it on charging for short intervals of time whenever you are not using it as it supports fast charging.6. Proprietary Application, the Sony app for these headphones comes with so many little tweaks and settings that could provide you with very personal experience according to your liking.Cons about XM4 -1. Can get hot, as they are closed back headphone so you could feel your ears warming up during long listening sessions.2. Might be a little big for you, as they are over the ear headphones so they may look a little big on ur head but you will get used to it eventually.3. No water resistance, so you may not be very suitable for gym during sweaty workout sessions.Overall I would highly recommend these headphones if you have the budget and you are looking for something which would last for years to come. Sound quality is amazing, fit and finish is on point, very comfortable for long sessions. I myself was using TWS in past and switching to wireless headphones was a great decision.",5.0,2 September 2023,22
4,Great pair of headphones money can buy,anmol aditya sinha,"I have gone through a lot of reviews on various platforms before buying this product, but at some few places i observed people mentioning about the  headphones causing them 'tinnitus', but as far as i am concerned i havent observed the same in my 10 days of usage so far. I am dividing my review into the below categories followed by pros/cons.1. Design and build quality: The design on these is a decent one, the build is definitely plastic, but dont  get me wrong, they definitely feel premium, and even though thet used plastic on these, but its  definitely good quality.2. Comfort: This is by far one of the most comfortable piece of headphones i have used so far, i mean  literally wear them for 3-4 hours and you wont feel that you have it on ur head on those times.  Although i havent stretched  by wearing them for longer periods than that, but i am pretty confident,  anyone will hardly have to worry on that aspect.3. Battery: I have found the battery life to be okay on these, they advertise a 30 hr backup but i think u  can easily get 20+ hours on these, so yeah this department is fine as well but in current market i have  seen different vendors like Marshall doing a phenomenal job with the battery by providing close to  80hrs in their 'Major 4' model of headphones, so yeah if you are some one for whom battery life is of  utmost importance, i would suggest you to get something similar to the Marshall Major 4s.4. Sound-Quality: The sound quality is amazing on these, and why not, these are Sony's, we can expect  the same from them, the low are detailed, mids are well tuned, highs are balanced, the bass is good  enough, but this is subjective, i mean these are not heavy bass set of pairs, for heavy bass you may look  for something like the XB series of the Sony's. But talking about the overall quality i am compelled to  say that these are definitely a bang for your buck.5. Noice-Cancellation: I kept this topic for the last but i dont think i need to talk much on these as these  definitely nail it, these are the king of ANC as i have already heard earlier at many places. they also give  u the option to customize the level of noise cancellation. As per me they are only 2nd to noice  cancellation after the Apple airpods max, but given the price point they completely justify what they  are offering. Regarding call quality, i didnt get much time to check the call quality except a couple of  occurences but found them to be decent. However if you are specifically looking forward to call quality,  the bose 700s can be a better option for you.Pros: 1. Great amount of customization provided by the sony app. 2. Timely firmware updates for the headphones. 3. Good enough carrying case of the headphones. 4. Less weight as compared to other premium offerings in this segment. 5. Decent battery life. 6. Mesmerizing sound.Cons: 1. Lack of aptx/aptx-hd codec: At this price point atleast they should offer aptx codec. 2. Lack of water/splash resistance: Given the premium segment, they should atleast offer splash rating  to these. 3. At this premium price point they should atleast offer a couple of years of warranty like the  Skullcandy's 4. Less number of support centers for these. 5. Lack of detachable earcups.Verdict: If you are ready to shell out this premium, then these headphones are definitely a good choice for you if you are looking for an allrounder.",5.0,28 January 2022,3
5,Best Instrument separation,Surya kumar,"Best goto headset for student…Don’t buy this if you have iPhone because you can’t make use of HiRes audio since Apple doesn’t support HiRes audio like android does…FLAC audio is very detailed in this headset…super comfortable on ears but gets sweaty after 10mins of use in summer… if you have AC in ur room, then no problem….Listen to ARR songs to get the details of it with good clarity…. Had fun hearing few instruments for the first time in this headset in songs which I was hearing for long time…Good built quality…. And the carrying pouch makes it very easy to carry it around…",5.0,21 April 2024,0
6,Best set of Cans to  listen Hi-Res music wirelessly and even wired,Aditya Chaturvedi,"After months of researching into many brands such as Audio technica, Beyerdynamic, Bose, AKG, it took hell lot of time to arrive to these.Basic requirements :- Long battery life, Hi-Res wireless, ANC, Bluetooth codec compatibility(LDAC required for Hi-Res music), long listening times - not much pressure on the jaw hinge.Pros :-+ Long battery life.+ Stable Bluetooth connection. Haven't experienced any distortion while moving around wearing these and phone put in my room.+ Codec Support - SBC, AAC, LDAC. No AptX or AptXHD in this model. If you looking for those codecs you might want to look the other way.+ Superb built quality with matte finish. resists fingerprints. Hinge folds/joints feels sturdy.+ ANC is stellar, drowns out most ambient sounds but higher frequencies could seep through but it will feel like someone is speaking from a good distance from you. You can put your hand on right cup to turn on ambient mode to talk. great feature to quickly talk and return back to music.+ Sound from the mics are also clear. People have no trouble in listening to my voice while on calls both cellular and online calls.+ It has a app by the name of headphones connect, which is full of useful features such has updating firmware of your headphones, analysing ambient sound to control ANC levels. it also analyses your ear shape to adapt sound output according to your ear shape and listening frequency. The app also tells which codec you are currently connected with.+ These also support 360 deg Reality Audio from various services and also includes 3-month trial which you can activate to listening Hi-Res 360RA audio.+ You can go wired(3.5mm cable included) and listen to Hi-Res lossless music with greater quality and clarity which current Bluetooth technologies cannot do. Even wired, you can turn on ANC and headphones post-processing tech to reproduce Hi quality music.+ Has a Proximity sensor inside the left cup which can detect wearing and un-wearing of headphones to play pause music.+gesture support to play pause, rewind, skip, volume-up/down from the right cup.Cons :- No Support to all Bluetooth codecs. The company should have given all the support at this kind of price.- I'd love to buy the white edition of these but they are not available in India only :(- Still find them expensive.I would suggest before going for these for listening Lossless music via Bluetooth and even wired, make sure your phone supports LDAC codec or else Hi-Res might not work. In the wired format, please check what kind of in-built DAC your phone has which can support Hi-Res output for at least 24-Bit/48Khz. If not then you need to buy an external portable USB-C DAC to listen to Hi-Res lossless upto 32bit/192khz.Hope this Helps!! Happy Listening :-)",5.0,24 August 2021,2

8,Great Headphone. Do need to fix glitches.,mayank maurya,"I am a video editor. This is my first Active Nosie Cancellation(anc) Headphone. And let's review it.PROS:1. Talking about Nosie Cancellation in general: using anc Headphone gives you option to block outside nosie. Which could be looked in other way i.e. you can listen in quite low volume than you used to.With anc off I am listening to  about 50-60% volume with anc on its 20-30%.At the end of day your ear are much pleased and relaxed which is big thing as next day I have repeat the same.2. EQ : app has several EQ to suit different people and their different needs.And it's very easy to tweak EQ.I love flat EQ. It helps in two ways.A. Reduce listening fatigue. I use headphone 8-10 hrs and end of day I don't feel listening fatigue.I haven't have used any I repeat any headphone which not cause listening fatigue. (Listening fatigue is different from headphone clamp force)B. As video editor I do need everything in its very neutral state. And then tweak from there. So yes this is amazing.3. I used various headphone and earphone but haven't listened to anything which match it's sound quality.People talk about track seperation. You could realise with this headphone for sure.4. App is so good. People don't talk about app. It's really good and ease to use.5. Dsse extreme : It do work. It improve person talking.6. Controls : touch feels more fresh and practical as you don't look/feel for right button but there are time when you hear chime and it don't do anything.I find Google assistant works great. You can say to assistant to change to next/prev song or volume% or pause. It's super fast not like you take 2 secs and assistant think and repeat your sentence. You say, release assistant button and it's done.Plus you can do all with just a single button and as I am right handed mostly my hand is occupied with mouse or pen hence busy.And control is on right side. And assistant button on left side. If you think to invert sides it changes how next and previous work.7. Auto power off and music pause  : I find this feature so useful. I hardly turn off the Headphone.Even auto pause is really good. It not work for vlc or premiere.8. Granual volume adjustable : there are time when you listen to specific volume. Like 25% not 20 or 30 it's possible. Both touch control and assistant.It may not look much but those small things make you listen you hours and don't feel fatigue at all.CONS and Feature request:1. Any anc Headphone would create a pressure in your ear. It's called cabin pressure. It's like sucking you ear with a less power vacuum cleaner.Hope it could be reduced.2. This headphone do cause heat around your ear. Well removing headphone for a minute would fix that.3. Sweat problem is for real. Its told in youtube reviews. But many headphone do cause sweat problem....again remove, clean and wear again.Both heat and sweat problem gonna have their real test in summers.4. I had expected anc to be top notch. Don't get me wrong but as first anc I expect too much. Think anc as volume reducer.I can still listen fan and some other noise.Look I am video editor and my ear had trained in a way to listen sort of sound. So anc could depend from person to personBut if you play a music at 20-25% it do reduce outside noise quite a lot.5. Battery life : company claim it's 30hrs with anc on and 50% volume.My anc is always on and I listen in 20-30% volume maybe reach to 40% as well time to time.But I have to charge every 2 day. It's like 16-20hrs battery life.I got first one replaced but second one is isn't getting any close to even 25hrs.I don't have problem with every 2 day charge. It's pretty good to me. But not matching company's standard.6. Bluetooth sometime do stutter. Turn off and now mostly fix it. But I need fixing c'mon sony.7. Hope we can use Google assistant to toggle noise cancellation and different EQ.8. Customizing option for custom button. You can make your own fav function to have.Verdict : If you someone who have to work for hours on computer or feel outside nosie act as distraction for you, you work music or video editing this would serve its purpose for sure. And yes also for travel enthusiast.Wear Headphone for 5+ hour to feel comfortable.Headphone won't cause pain in ear. But cabin pressure and heat and sweat are problematic. It won't cause headache to me. Maybe if you listen to few hrs it would make you adjusted for that.Sound is amazing. Comfort is great so does anc but those could be further improved.Look no headphone I had used in past which could match it's comfort. I actually wear for 8-10 hrs each day. Well who doesn't need more improved products.",4.0,18 October 2020,46
9,Sound Quality is Amazing but not the best,Ahmed,"The noise cancellation makes you feel like you’re in a library. I really like how the equaliser is customisable. It is really comfortable, have worn them for like 4-5 hours without any issues. The Sound Quality is great but not at the level I expected for the price point. Still feels premium and very well built though. Good for students but not the best for Audiophiles.",4.0,18 April 2024,0
10,Goated,Aniket Das,"Between this and the xm5,the xm5s don't fold so it makes a big bulge in my backpack is fairly inconvenient. So returned it and bought the xm4s and it is as good as the xm5s (the xm5s do have better mic quality and slightly better instrument seperation).",5.0,7 May 2024,0
11,Ultimate Product!,Placeholder,"Build quality is ultimate, Performance is ultimate, It is also good from the point of portability, Easy to control volume, Solid Durability & Appearance is Superb!! ""Perfect 10/10"" ❤️👌",5.0,3 May 2024,0
12,Avoid this very hyped expensive product. Right hinge swivel broke within a year.,Saurabh Mishra,"Purchased it after receiving positive reviews from various online platforms and youtube reviewers. Received this on May 10, 2023. But, after almost a year of usage I can tell that this is at best a very hyped expensive okayish product with poor build quality.The right hinge swivel broke within a year while putting on the headphones, which is weird as one expects good build quality from products which are in the premium price segment. Sony does not cover this damage under their 1 yr standard warranty. I've not been able to get this repaired as few authorised centers refuse to repair it and others want me to shell out INR 5k-6k.Although, it is priced around the 20k price band in India, it does not deliver a premium experience. Some brands deliver a better audio output at a lower price band. It's difficult to wear these for longer stretches as the ears accumulate sweat. The adaptive noise cancellation misfires most of the time which gets irritating with usage. It does not block out the room fan noise. Also, some distant noises would always get into the noise cancellation spectrum. The mic is decent during phone calls. The overall audio experience and build quality does not justify the price one pays for this product.Hence, avoid if you can.",3.0,27 April 2024,0
13,Comfortable ! ANC could be better,Siddant,Headphones are very comfortable. You can wear them for hours but your ears will become hot so need to adjust inbetween. Sound is awesome as expected from Sony. First I didn't like the sound but adjusting it from equaliser it sounds awesome. ANC is not that great which people talk about. For office use ANC is good. But if you go out in market or in airport or plane you can clearly hear the announcement and muffeled noice of chatter. But if are playing something in it then it's fine but if you are wearing them for the sake concentration it might not work that well.,4.0,24 February 2024,0

21,Just Amazing!!!!,AARAV,"I have purchased this headphone  (sony wh-1000xm4) during the republic day sale at cost of approximately 17,500 rupees. Before that i was looking for the sennheiser momentum 4. But after researching some articles like ratings.com there i found with the help of a lots of graphs and rating that M4's have slightly better sound staging than the XM4's. But its not a huge difference like which they have in their price. But the difference was in their ANC's like XM4's totally destroy the M4's in ANC department.Particularly, If I talk about the WH-1000XM4's then I'll say just go for it. Its sound quality is just phenomenal. It sounds like... means that should be sound in actual. The bass is not boomyy, muddy or over done. Bass comes when its required only with proper kick's. Mids and treble are also done very well, you can easily point out each and every instruments of music or songs. ANC is amazing too indeed. If you can really spend this much amount on a headphone, then trust me these XM4's will not gonna to disapoint you with its sound and ANC qualities. From my side its a must buy product.....(Thank You)",5.0,27 January 2024,0

23,The best.,Vishal J.,It's a pleasure to have this headphone. Every song feels great. Bass is amazing & so is the mids. Features are good too. Touch sensitive works really smoothly. ANC works perfectly for me. Would recommend this highly.,5.0,2 April 2024,0
24,The undeniable crush!,SACHIN VASHIST,"I literally had a crush on it since it launched but couldn't afford it that time tbh but irony start when xm5 launched and now am able to buy any of them,I had started comparing both xm4s & xm5s got to know some differentiator which might help you guys choosing out your ideal daily driver!Looks:- boy o boy i cannot resist how cool this beige coloured xm4 looks in real! One of my main concern to look stand out at airport and it delivered 😁Comfort:- i had compared both headphones at croma so that i could feel which ear cushioning suits me the most and tbh xm4s have slightly thicker cups than that of xm5s, also headband feels more comfortable but won't deny xm5 headband feels more snugg and reliable. On the flip side while using my xm4 in gym it feels bit slippery on ears while sweating and you'll definitely feel some heft of your head after using it for long periods like 2-3 hrsBattery:- I use them very frequently so in my case it almost lasts for about 20hr without anc & ambient control on but have heard many times people saying it last around 30hrs too idk maybe it's just mine which is hungry of being charged frequently lolBest part Sound:- if you're an audiophile my clear suggestion would be No! Don't buy these, the default sound of these headphones are trash feels like sound is muffled and you won't be able to differentiate any highs lows and mids , only rescuver is sony headphones app's bright settings then you'd start feel like my 20k hasn't wasted the bass is literally overpowering that why i bought them because i mostly use it gym or while traveling and when i compared it with xm5s this literally overshadowed xm5s bass like a champ so my suggestion would be go for airpods 2 or xm5 for balanced sound, bose 700 for audiophile and xm4 for gym heavies and bass loversThe xm4 journey is a loop you'll return from where you started i have called it an ""undeniable crush"" because you can't resist from its look and feel also case and foldability (for some audience) but have to live with the pain of not so sharp vocals and balanced sound and last but not least the ambient control is trash i mean literally trash! Even it creates fake a fan's air noise and you'll feel wtf? So it upto you guy if these are your crush then you'd end up having these despite knowing the reality nonetheless.

25,The best in the business,Srivatsan Sridhar,"Easily one of the best noise cancelling headphones available in the market. I don't see any difference between the XM4 and the XM5, so I would recommend to get this instead of the latest XM5.",5.0,1 April 2024,0
26,"As someone else in this review section said "" conditionally recommend""",Nikhil Ranjit,"Update sept 26Got the replacement set and they sound do much better than the first ones I recieved. This kind of issues is unheard of from a product that costs 30k not gonna lie. Seriosuly? A defective pair of headphones ? Unexpected sony !Update- sept-25So I was  using these like.usual when I started hearing a shrill noise from the right side earcup! Tried it with multiple devices , persistsnt shrill noise with noise cancelion and no music( my room's fan was off ) . Replacing for a new pair . Will updateI'm not a ""audiophile"" but I've tested and heard many headphones/earphones in search of the ""perfect"" pair of cans for me. Perfect is a subjective term and will vary from person to person.I bought these becasue of all the hype with the xm3's and as a customer the ""next"" version would obviously be better right ?So, come delivery day. I ooened these, set them up, updated the firmware and started listening . These sound , ok. For something that costs 30k, these sound average at best. The noice cancelling is good but I need to test it more , possibly on an airplane ( whenever that happens )When something is this expensive you automatically have some expectations from it right ? It has to perform at the 30k level ( I hope the reader is getting what I'm trying to say) .The software features are great , the build feels premium, the connection is strong.P.S if you intend to use the multipoint function you will loose audio quality . LDAC uses two lanes ( max for bluetooth 5.0) and when you use multipoint it switches to SBC ( 1 lane ) so expect quality loss. Windows doesn't support LDAC so you will loose significant quality when connected to a pc.I'll update the review after the burn in period . I won't be returning these since these are just too damn comfortable but doesn't justify the 30k price tag it demands for the sound quality I'm getting as of 20 sept.",4.0,20 September 2020,259

Overall sound quality is good and deliver punch bass but only if you tuned for your convenience or else it is a normal Sony boom headset with added features.I am an Android user so I don't know about apple user sound quality may top notch on this device.

30,From a Windows User Perspective,Venkata D.,"Owning a noise cancelling headset is a 9-year-old dream of mine. I never was able to justify paying 25 to 30k though. Finally, my wife decided to gift me the headset for my birthday. I have read and a lot of reviews for this headset online. All of them are from the perspective of a cell phone user. I use my headset mainly with my laptop and my iPad. Having dual connectivity was a must feature for me because I have a movie or YouTube video playing on my iPad and continue to work on my laptop. I take around 3 to 4 hours of zoom calls on a typical working day so call quality was also a very big priority. Now that you have the back story here are pros and cons.Pros1) Very comfortable. I use them for around 10 to 15 hours a day and I feel a discomfort after having them on for at least 5 hours. I think that is good enough session without taking a break.2) Noise Cancelling – As long as you don’t expect miracles. It does a good job of blocking the fans in my room, my laptop fan, my keyboard noise. If you have a TV on you can still hear it (although at a low volume).3) Connectivity – I didn’t have any issues with the connectivity in the two weeks I have been using this for. Connection was always stable.4) Sound Quality – I am no audiophile. My music source is Apple Music. I am happy with the way my music sounds or twitch steams sounds.Cons1) Call Quality – I am not sure if this is an issue in just my device or if it is a common issue. But, almost every time I take a call on zoom for the first 2 to 3 minutes, it sounds like other persons voice is coming from a tube. I didn’t face this issue while taking calls from phone or iPad. So, I don’t know what exactly is causing this issue but is super annoying to deal with every time.2) Battery Life – Please don’t go by advertised battery life. I never got more than 16 hours. Which is nothing to laugh at and can still last me through a working day and I can charge it once every day.3) APTX – These headphones don’t support APTX or APTX HD. As an IOS and windows user the best I can use these headphones with is AAC which is a bit disappointing. Some of my friends own XM3 and they are super happy with them on windows. My suggestion is if multi connection is not a must for you go for the XM3. They are still a very good headset and they give you excellent call quality on windows.4) Speak to chat – Even after setting the sensitivity to low it gets activated every time I hum the song even very slowly. Good that it can be turned off in the app and I turned it off in the first two days of usage.Despite the cons I love these headphones to bits and pieces. I hope the call quality issue resolves with more burn in or with a software update down the line. I used XM3s, Bose QC 25, 35, 35II and NC 700 (borrowed from my friends). I think these and XM3 have the best audio quality if you a general user. I have no idea about audiophile level details. If your budget permits and you don’t take a lot of calls on windows laptops, I would say go for these.",4.0,1 November 2020,18

33,Mind blowing product from Sony,Amazon Customer,"I must admit I was so very confused between Xm4 and Xm5 model of sony headsets but then I asked few basic questions to myself like main purpose of purchase and usage, my answer was Xm4 considering the price point I had to pay for Xm5. My usage is mainly around watching TV, listening to music and few calls (usage frequency is very low).Please note since I am no expert so my ratings below are totally my opinion and personal experience. Xm5 surely blows out xm4 when it comes to ANC and few other added features, rest xm4 has been best for a reason from last few years. If you love bass xm4 will give you more puch than xm5. Plus portability wise xm4 is ahead of xm5, though xm5 looks more premium but it takes more space and has a bigger carry pouch since it does not fold. Neither of the products are waterproof so be careful when taking it out for workout (excessive sweat may cause a damage) or plan to step out while it rains.Bass: 4.5/5Clarity: 4/5Portability: 4.5/5ANC: 4/5Call Quality: 4/5Since Xm5 is selling like hot cake in the market I just thought I would share my experience with both of the headsets. I did try them at Croma before buying it off on Amazon.",4.0,27 October 2023,2

40,Best headphones under 20k,Suraj,"After a long research, I finally chose XM4 over XM5. I could have spent extra 10k if that was worth it. But few pointers that help me choosing XM4 are:-1. XM4 has better ratings than XM5 at Amazon.2. Reddit, YT, Blogs say XM5 isn't really a successor but just a competitor with slight improvements like slighter better ANC, Call quality. If you're not an Audio Engineer or a Music creator - these slight improvements wouldn't matter to you much.3. XM4 is more compact. Foldable in a hand-sized pouch.I purchased Sony XM4 headphones during the Great Indian Sale for around 20k.This review is after few hours of usage.Sound quality 🔊 - Best in classANC - Powerful💪Comfort - GreatGrip - Satisfactory (can't run with these:)Yes it's true that you can clearly hear every instruments sound. It's made for people who listen songs for a long time. Earlier  have used Realme ANC-earbuds, they hurt ear. But this doesn't at all. These have touch screen gesture controls on right side - really stylish to use. One great feature I liked is you can swiftly switch back and forth between Transparent and ANC mode by placing your hand on the right side cup. I would conclude by saying as a music lover it was really a dream come true to finally own the Sony premium ANC headphones.-1 star because while walking the speakers flickers a lot. I guess these are not designed for use while running or walking. Well nothing is perfect in this world- so this is what it is.",4.0,5 August 2023,10

44,My honest words on MX4,Vihar ghul,"Well, this is my first pair of noise cancelling headphones it is bit annoying for me that my ears are feeling little bit of air pressure difference while on noise cancelling mode. Maybe over a period of time. I will get a adaptation to this new technology.About sound qualityThey are loud enough & having bit more Bass heavy sound signature, Maybe out of the box you won’t find the perfect sound for yourself but after playing with sony connect app, you’ll find a perfect sound signature for your ears.About noise cancellationIt is good, but do not expect out of the world experience. It reduces down many low frequency noise but cannot give you 100% isolation feeling.Look and feel of the productO boy i am in love with the look and feel of the product, They feels so premium. Even I prefer MX4 design over MX5. Design is only the reason I went for MX4 instead of MX5.Comfort levelThey are the most comfortable headphones. I have ever used till now here design of the headphone makes it most comfortable for long listening sessions so no complains about comfort.Should we purchase xm4 in 2023As per my point of view, every new technology comes with little bit of here and there improvement and will charge you bunch of money for it where little old technology comes with great price point and almost 90% of features. So this is the best deal you can crack in 2023.Purchase adviceIf you have any store near your home, where you can experience both XM5 and XM4, then do experience it before purchasing it then make your decision because each and every person have their own sound signature preference you should experience by yourself to know which is your preference.",5.0,7 August 2023,3

48,"Great Headphones, but Not for Everyone",@r.ohitrai,"I recently purchased these headphones, and while they are undoubtedly the best of their kind, I must caution those who don't want to feel like they're in their own world, cut off from the outside. If you're someone who values being aware of your surroundings or needs to stay alert, these might not be the right choice for you. These headphones provide an immersive audio experience that can make you feel like a ""deaf"" to the world around you. However, if you're all about exceptional sound quality and don't minod the isolation, these headphones are an outstanding choice.Fit: These headphones are incredibly comfortable and provide a secure fit, ensuring they stay in place during any activity.Voice Quality: The audio quality is second to none, delivering crisp, clear, and immersive sound. Whether you're a music enthusiast or use them for calls, you won't be disappointed.Size: They strike the perfect balance between being compact and still offering fantastic features. You can easily carry them with you wherever you go.Durability: These headphones are built to last, with robust construction that can withstand the test of time and use.Portability: Their sleek design and foldable structure make them highly portable. They're your ideal travel companion.Clarity: The clarity of sound they deliver is unparalleled, ensuring you catch every nuance in your music or conversation.",5.0,4 November 2023,4

51,Overall great headphones with wide support (not limited to iPhones),Placeholder,"I have been using these for two weeks now, I found them super useful.So first of all Noise cancellation, Which is very good. I usually use it while reading or focusing on tasks in the office.I won't say Noise cancellation is perfect. But it cuts out almost everything that is noise. Like, When I have it on, I can hear my friend speaking next to me but everything else is just muted, like fan sound, wind, vehicles outside, etc.  It has touch controlls which can be used to change volume and change songs. or play or pause. or even pick up call.  And It also has this feature of speech detection, which might be useful to some people. So whenever you speak something it will turn off noise cancellation for a moment to let you hear others and let yourself be heard. For me it's not that useful, I found it annoying sometimes. So i keep it off. There's another way of talking with others, Just place your hand on right earphone when someone is saying something to you, It automatically turn on ambience mode which you will be able to hear the surroundings and as soon as you remove your hand, again Noise cancellation.The music quality is amazing. It supports hires lossless audio. I use apple music and I am even able to play 24bit 96Hz audio with so much clarity. You will hear every tune. speaking of hearing every tune...It supports two device connections at once, So If you are listening to music on your PC, and someone calls you on phone it automatically swiches output from phone, and again with it's touch controls on right side of hearphones you can pick up the call.Mic quality is decent. i won't say most amazing sound but it's good enough with noise cancellation. I had to replace the headphones once because the once i received had mic issues, But even replacement was so easy from Amazon.Battery life is according  to sony is 30Hrs, in real life I can see It's pretty good, I use it regularly, I have to charge every 2 days. But also it depends on how much use I have in a day. All around it's good. And the carrying bag is very useful.Plus it's not limited to iPhones or Androids like some headphones and earbuds do. So it's a plus. It has all features accessible from both android and iOS.",5.0,7 October 2022,0
52,"Poor Microphone performance, excellent ANC for your ears",HMX,"Update: Thu/01/July/2021The replacement arrived, and performed exactly as the earlier device - poor microphone performance. Hence asked Amazon to return the headset, and it is now scheduled to be picked up.Tue/29/June/2021Okay, it's only Day 3 of this headset for me but I have asked for a replacement. It will arrive tomorrow, I hope it is better.I was using a 15 months old JBL 650BTC, and had a client escalate about background noise on my calls (intesntivie in his WFH ways of working from the client, but what can I say) and hence was forced to upgrade to something better. In a fit of rage, I looked at the best rated headphones and decided to pick up the XM4 over XM3 which was available for INR 8000 less, assuming that this would be an huge improvement. Yep, I made that mistake of buying in a hush.The order arrived as promised, however the Amazon bill was inside the product box, instead of inside the AMAZON packaging. I didn't think of it much at that time because I wanted to try this headset real quick. But before I provide my larger experience / review, I want to address the elephant in the this review section:IT HAS THE WORSE MICROPHONE PERFORMANCE THAN JBL 650BTC THAT I BOUGHT FOR INR 9,999There, I said it. It really is so worse. There is a huge wind noise if a fan is running even at 50% capacity which is discomforting to the other person on the call. Any background noises are not even muffled. Even when I reported an issue with this headset, the Amazon Tech specialist could clearly feel the discomfort from the moment I switched to XM4 headphones on my phone. When I disconnected from XM4 and used my iPhone, that does a much much better job at cancelling background noise - and in his words ""Oh such a relief, suddenly your voice has become sweeter"".My need:A very good headphones which cancels out noise around my background (kids playing or running around at times) for my work related calls on Teams/Skype/Zoom.Setting up:It was easy to connect the headset to my phone and laptop and it was a rather straight forward process. The Sony Headphones software is very quirky and definitely not the best out there (on iOS device). UX is real bad and it is confusing for the first time users. Took a while to get my head around setting it up. It will take a while getting used to it.Battery Life:The 30 hour battery life being claimed, has so far lived up to it. In the three days, I have used it for about 20 hours, and after charging for the first time, about 40% of battery still available. With usage this would come down as battery life goes, however this is promising.Music and Sound QualityTwo stars only because listening to music is fantastic, and it is something that I cherish about this product. That said, for audiophiles, this may be a good/better/best alternative to other phones depending on their choice of music and preferences. I enjoyed listening to the music on this device, the ANC for listen works perhaps the best I have tried (I have tried the BOSE QC35 as well) and can attest that it does a super job of silencing the outside noise for you. Perhaps the best at that, I would argue.This does not solve my problem though. I need this headset primarily for calls, and secondly for music. For a headphone this expensive, the superb microphone performance is the least you would expect! Rather, it is just a given it should and XM4 fails terribly at that.",2.0,29 June 2021,3

56,Over hyped headset,VK,"This item was in my wishlist for quite sometime, I finally bought it and felt cheated as soon as I opened the package, I received an already unboxed item, which was definitely used before as can be ascertained by the dust on the inside of the ear cups, I requested for a replacement and amazon was really helpful.I received a new device two days later, it's a brand new one with proper packing and I was excited to use this.  I primarily wanted it for my office calls and listen to some songs now and then.The main problem with this headset is the software, the sony connect app helps you toggle between various ambient modes, noise cancelling was the most hyped feature in this headset, and it works average at best, I can still hear the rumbling of fan, although subdued, it's not completely gone.Disappointed with the noise cancelling, I chose to keep it turned off for the time being, but there is no way to persist that, when ever you turn on the headset, it defaults to noise cancelling mode, that is Ok, but trying to turn it off is again is a bit confusing, you have to turn off multiple options in the sony app to turn off the noise cancelling.Coming to the audio part, honestly speaking I don't know what highs and lows are, I'm just interested about my experience, and I expected this headset to wow me, but it didn't. It was quite average, I tried fiddling with the various Equalizer settings, but nothing worked, you may think I was looking for Bass, but quite the opposite actually, I prefer the slower paced songs, but didn't find the clarity that I was expecting. I even noticed a crackling sound when playing songs.Coming to the office calls part, I took a few calls with this, the call quality was good, except for once when I heard a periodic buzzing sound, I checked with the other person if there is some noise on his side, he told me there is none, not even a fan.Major selling point of this device for me was the multi device support, I bought it just so that I can take calls both on my phone and laptop. This turned out to be another disappointment, while I was able to connect to 2 devices, the audio is completely lost if there was any sound from the second device, while audio from the first is playing, notification beeps on either device stopped sound from both devices, you have to restart the headset for it work again, this was the breaking point for me.It is comfortable to wear and has quite a premium feel, the build quality is really good. I would have been happy to keep using it if the software was any good, I feel the sony headphone connect app makes it quite difficult to use.May be go for it, if you plan to use it on a single device and not worried too much about audio quality.I have read lot of reviews on this, It has been the most favoured headset of MKBHD and many famous tech reviewers, I'm disappointed it didn't meet my expectations.",3.0,25 June 2021,2

But man is the noise cancellation something... I have tried it inside a party with 4 loud speakers booming and I have stood in front of it (where I could feel all the thumps on my chest) and whole wearing these headphones with no music playing it already was cancelling our atleast 50% of the noise (music by the 4 loudspeakers) and after playing music through it, car bassy one at full volume on YouTube music streaming at 256kbps... Damn it blocked 80% of the the speaker noise 💀One more thing that as these are proper LDAC headphones, please have Spotify or Tidal subscription if you want the full experience of these amazing pair, cause as an audiophile myself I did notice huge improvement over these two music services at their premium subscription compared to before. And this is on Bluetooth, if you feel like it's not that loud enough or whatever it is, you still have that aux option via pc (while connecting it to phone unless you have a good dac on your phone, it's not recommended as most pc motherboards have much better dac than phones)That's it, what are you waiting for?

60,Best noise cancellation headphone in the price,Arikaran P,This is my review after 40 days of usage.This is basically best comfortable and best noise cancelling headphones in the world. Design is fantasticUltra premium finish 😁Cushions are soft and re place with newBattery: 17 to 18 hrsSo the best part is : sound qualityDon't expect much. Sound is not tht greatEverything is flat and medium loud.This can be compared again 3k rs tws. In sound part.So if sound is your priority then get something else.Noise cancellation is main thing and the quality of SONY is your cup of cake. The go for it,5.0,30 November 2023,3
61,Excellent noise cancellation performance but average sound quality.,Shubham Chaudhary,Build quality: Excellent build quality. Soft touch finish looks and feels very premium. Earcups are soft and comfortable. Clamping force is very balanced. Hard shell carrying case is of very good quality.Sound quality: Out of the box sound quality is poor for its price. Bass is muddy and vocals are suppressed. Treble is harsh and sibilant.After stressing it for few hours and using EQ the sound quality improved significantly. But it's still average to above average for its price range.Using custom EQ improved vocals and instruments greatly. Bass is ample on these pair and using EQ improves it's tightness and muddiness.Instrument separation is very good. You can hear every instrument clearly.Sound stage is narrow. It's only slightly wider than earphones.Noise cancellation: Excellent noise cancellation. Removes almost all low frequency sounds and greatly reduces vocals and highs. Easily on of the best noise cancellation performance on the market for the price.Ambient mode: Average quality of ambient mode. The sound doesn't feel natural it has very digital or processed feel to it. You can hear everything clearly tho.Battery life: good battery life. I have to charge it once a week. Gives me about 20hrs on ldac. Note that 30hrs specified by company is with ANC and speak to chat on off.Features:  Gesture control is very good. Tap and swipe gestures work really well but it's not 100% accurate.Can connect to multiple devices.Headphones app from Sony is very good and provide with decent amount of setting. You can adjust everything these headphones through this app.Pros: Industry leading active noise cancellation.Excellent build quality.Very comfortable.Decent battery lifeGood sound quality (after EQ adjustment)Cons: Sound quality could have been better.Battery life is on lower side compared to other headphones in similar price range.Can get sweaty after prolonged use in warmer climates.Note: I bought these in great festival sale for 16.5k rupees.,4.0,28 October 2022,6
62,Absolute beast of a unit!,Peter,"I am living the XM4’s quite a lot!I was planning on buying the XM5’s or the AirPods Max instead, but I received them at an incredible bargain of a price, so I thought why not purchase them instead, and then, in the future, I’ll upgrade them.And my decision was right. They fold, unlike the XM5’s that do not fold, they have a satisfying size adjusting click that XM5’s don’t, and above all, the noice cancelling optimiser feature that Sony sadly got rid of on the XM5’s.Overall, a solid product by Sony, and thank you Amazon for a satisfying one day prime delivery, and a polite executive.This is my review after 10 days of usage, will update it in the future, as and when needed.",5.0,12 November 2023,0

Long lasting battery.Fits okay, but if your head is small you always feel it is going to fall.It can connect to 2 devices simultaneously I used it with windows, Android and Apple and it works well.The carry case is good to carry it as it folds and saves lot of space. Fits in back pack.Audio is good and clear. Overall build quality is good.Con: if you wear for extended period of time, it starts making you uncomfortable and gives pain in ears. Only because of this 4 star otherwise it would be a 5star.",4.0,23 September 2023,6
64,My Honest Review: Very much satisfied with my purchase,Riche Mattews S,"I bought this product Sony WH-1000XM4 on Feb'22 (MKBHD suggestions) and have been using it for more than a year now. I am very happy with this product.Pros:- The noise cancelling is excellent- Bluetooth connectivity is seamless- Power life is very convenient especially for a single device use (have used it for gaming (R6 siege where sound is key also other games as well), movies, series & songs- Touch sensitive feature is pretty responsive- Build quality is solid and is premium looking- More importantly it is very comfortable, you won't feel any pain around your ears/headCons:- You would have to lie down up-straight because it may activate the touch sensors turned right side, not so convenient if you turned left side lying down- Very slightly you would feel gaps around your ears if you wear glasses, but not so noticeable- If the atmosphere is hot, you definitely sweat around your earsI am satisfied with my purchase especially for my daily use like games (R6, Apex), songs, movies, commute - flight/train/buses (you wouldn't hear any background noise thanks to ANC).Wouldn't suggest you use it when you are babysitting/taking care of someone because you would literally hear zero background noise when you are using the headphones with ANC.",5.0,7 July 2023,5

66,Best sounding headphones with added benefit of noise cancellation,Advait,"The best part about these headphones has to be the sound quality. I also really appreciate the fact that they provided a sturdy case along with it. Been using it for more than 6 months now and have to say that i did notice some plastic creaking sound while i move around wearing them which is initially annoying and noise cancellation makes it worse, but you get used to it. Noise cancellation is also good but i have tried airpods pro 2 and (i know they are earbuds) they do a better job at it than XM4s. Overall i would say that buy them if you want a rich musical experience!",4.0,24 August 2023,4

68,Best for music but not for calls,Lokeshwar K,"I’ve been using this headphone for almost 10 days now. The sound quality and the bass are great, best in class I would say for this price range.Pros:1. Superior sound quality, good for movies and music2. Best in class ANC3. Excellent battery backup4. Build quality and matte finish are top notch5. Touch controls are very helpful, you can do most of the work without touching your laptop or mobile.Cons:1. The call quality is not up to the mark, the side tone feature is enabled by default and there is no option to switch it off.Sidetone meaning: it’s an additional or unwanted feature. Which enables you to listen to the environment and your own voice to some extent. Just to ensure you are not shouting during calls.All other brands like JBL and Bose have option to disable this but in Sony it’s not optional. Irritating most of the times2. The box or the case, congested. You have to get used to bending your headphone every time you put it into the case.3. The charging cable. Very small and not very useful unless you charge your headphone using a power bank.4. The AUX cable doesn’t have a mic. For this price range Sony could have easily added a mic in aux.5. The App, quite buggy. Inconsistent connectivity. Sometime even though the phone is connected to headphone the app shows it’s not connected.6. No option to mute the mic with the touch controls.In spite of so many cons I would still rate this 4 star just for the quality of sound it produces.Note: Buy this if you are music lover. If you are looking for an headphone for office or business calls then I would suggest you can better go for Bose 700.",4.0,9 October 2022,12

73,Probably the best NC phones in the market today but issues with controls,Prasanna Bhalerao,"There are enough reviews on the web space on this product. I agree with all. These are possibly the world's best NC phones today, feature-rich and top-notch quality. I would like to mention real-world use. I will mention some niggles and drawbacks that you may or may not face:- The first issue is with the Bluetooth (BT) connection. BT, as everyone knows, has never been perfected. First time pairing is quick enough but if for some reason the pairing drops, it is not easy to reset. Please do note that I am a VERY TECH-SAVVY person. I purchased this for my uncle who is an elderly person and he faced the issue.- The controls (Volume +/-, Track +/-) are on the right ear cup. Place the finger around the middle of the left cup and move it up/down for volume and front/rear for tracks. It is not intuitive to an elderly person. I think it works for me but ... Buttons are good for elderly person but they can be too small and buttons are mechanical, prone to damage. Point is know your age and limitations.- The headphones can pair with two sources and can switch between the two. For example, one source could be the TV or Music system, the other could be the phone. The switching is not easy or automatic. For example, I may be connected to music system and while thus engrossed, if I receive a telephone call, I would like the headphones to switch to phone automatically and let me hear/speak on the call. I know that this is a feature. I have not been able to figure this out but it is early days.- The Sony Heaphone Connect app is nearly an absolute requirement and it has niggles.But overall, it is a great piece of engineering.One question often pops up Sony WH-100XM4 or or Bose NC-700 or Bose QC-35I would say between the three, purely based on sound quality, it is a toss of the coin, the Sony wins on features whereas the Bose phones are much more comfortable over the ears (I have QC-25 and QC-35 is nearly an identical sibling with wireless BT. NC is at par on XM4 and QC-35. I don't have the NC-700. Sony and QC-35 have better battery life.",4.0,16 June 2021,0
74,Noise cancellation plus celing fan is a disaster,Shanu Koyakutty,"The headphones are the best when it comes to noise cancellation. With the Automatic Noise Cancellation (ANC) mode, you will not here ""most"" of the natural noises like that of vehicles, rain, etc. The communications though it will block, it is not designed to fully eliminate the noise created by people which you can see in the Sony FAQ. The sound quality is great. But there is an issue. If you are using under a ceiling fan, and you switch on ANC (full noise cancellation), you will get a sensation of wind noise coming in (to describe the noise, if you are taking a video with your mobile phone while travelling in your vehicle with the windshields down facing towards to direction of the vehicle, and you play the video afterwards, you will hear the same wind noise that you feel in this headset). The only way you can eliminate it is with the help of slider in Sony Headphones app and selecting the Wind Noise Cancellation (Wind NC) option, but that is not pure noise cancellation. You will here some ambient noise in the process. On top of that, it would be difficult to set it to Wind NC when you are connected just to your laptop. (Note: There is a windows app in github which does function similar to the slider in Sony Headphones app, and although it is buggy and not supported by Sony, it does the job.) For a headphone this costly, if it can't cancel and on top of that, add some extra wind noise, it is very disheartening. Since I thought it is a defect, I replaced the product within the replacement window, but the replaced one too have the same issue. You can see hundreds of review for the same issue in the internet saying that it happens in humid climate where there is moisture and to try ""silica-gel method"" to prevent the mosture, but nothing works when you are under the ceiling fan. (Perhaps, the product was not designed keeping Indian households into consideration and our extensive use of ceiling fans which creates a wind-like effect vertically) If you need to search for the issue online, go for something like ""static crackling sound"" keyword.I had a word with Sony technician and he asked me to go visit the Service Center. I will visit there Monday and provide further updates. If I can't fix it within the return window, I will return the product since I don't see why I should patronize a much hyped, too costly product if it can provide me with noise cancellation for my WFH but with terms and conditions applied. If you are using air conditioner, and for frequent travels, this is a great product. (Can't compare with other products since that is not my job and I don't have access to those headphones)",3.0,16 October 2021,2

82,Best in class sound and voice,Vaibhav Rai,"Feedback after 2 months of usage.Well what do i say. Prolonged working hours add to stress on your back. Wired headsets ensure you are leashed to you system, moreover they add stress on your ears. I spend 6-7 hours everyday over calls/online meetings. Suddenly the bulb in my head blipped and i just picked up Sony WH 1000MX4.Bonkers. Now I am u leashed. I can walk from my cabin to next without my system while still connected to my calls/meetings.The look and feel of the entire product is luxe. Ear sponge is super comfy and does not cause problem for couple of hours. But if u keep it on for hours without a break, you may feel discomfort around your ear. And that is how nature built human body.ANC is amazing. You wont even know if someone walked up behind you and is trying to talk to you if you are listening to audio.Mic quality is just great. You will sound crisp and clear. No echos, distortion at all. Tested in best way, few others i know are using same headphone and i have heard then speak on multiple devices like the same headphone, poly sync 40+, iphone & S21 Ultra.Battery life is amazing. I charge it for an hour before my day starts and it survives for ~12 hours. I am using a PD adapter.If you use this for work only and have a travel planned. Dont worry. There is an amazing hard case which Sony provides. Quality again speaks luxe.Overall I would say, dont hesitate to sped your money on this product. While some may say there are other products at cheaper rate available.

They sound soooo nice and amazing I am not a music freak and I cannot tell about this bass, treble and stuff but its perfect and its worth the 20K...Coming to the charging omg I charge once in 2 weeks I guess even after using daily... the best againOverall: Go for it, its too good and just watch out for some deals wait, you will find the better price, xD.

88,Very good noise cancelling and excellent sound,Aar Bee,"Just bought these headphones on recommendation from a friend how has M3 Model of the same. So far, I am impressed with the quality of the sound and the noise cancelling.I flew from Delhi to Montreal (16 hours flight) and then from Montreal to San Francisco (6 hours flight). The battery lasted through the flight but after another 1 hour of usage at home, I got a prompt from the headphones that battery is running low so it will probably last another couple of hours. So effectively on full charge it lasted around 25 hours with noise cancelling ON all the time. Blue tooth was Not used on the plane, it was connected to the entertainment system via an external wire. 25 hours is less than what is advertised. But if it can last through out the flight across the globe, I would say it is great!Noise cancelling was very good and very similar to QC45 Bose headphones that I used while flying to Delhi from San Francisco (somebody stole my Bose QC45 on the plane so I had to buy these Sony headphones). Like Bose, It suppresses more than 90% of the plane engine noise and with music/movie playing, you will not notice the noise of the plane at all.I felt some discomfort on my ears but then realized it was the legs of my reading glasses pressing against my ears. So if you wear glasses, you will have to adjust where you put them. Having legs right behind the ears my cause discomfort.Use of buttons is intuitive and easy. The feature where it stops the Noise cancelling when you begin to talk is cool. Also the feature where it stops the music if you take off headphones is good too. Overall, I would recommend these.",4.0,22 July 2022,8

93,Good nothing great.,Shashank K.,"I wanted to buy XM5 but giving there is so much mixed reviews about XM4 & XM5. I ended up buying XM4 since lot of reviews says XM5’s are tad bit improvement over XM4’s. Hence XM4 offers best features for its given price. I got it for 18.4K in sale.Lets just say I might be wrong. I’m giving an early review. I’m have been using Airpods pro and in comparison to that lets just say the noise cancellation of XM4 is nothing great. It’s pretty average. Only the low frequency sounds are cancelling rest nothing is canceled as expected. May be I am used to the air suction that Airpods create.  I mean I could hear full blown conversation of people sitting in next room with slight reduction in noise level. Sound is normal to good you can customise it. Bluetooth connectivity is fast but i have experienced lag couple of times. If you have a bigger ears it might be uncomfortable. I have bit bigger ear so still figuring out if it is comfortable or not. I’m not finding any problems as such. The case size is big plus point due to folding functionality. Its small & compact unlike XM5’s.I would say if you have already decided to buy XM5 & have the budget for it , stick to it. Don’t get confused by the internet reviews. XM4 is still good if the budget is below 20k.",3.0,14 August 2023,2

It should not go obsolete in just a couple of yearsHence, I chose XM4's over the others, it's still relevant, sounds awesome, has decent build quality, you can get replaceable ear pads easily, comes with a good hard case, it cost lesser than the rest and its technology won't go obsolete in another 5 years at least. It meets my needs and serves my purpose.I use it usually to study online or video post-processing, and on the Go (traveling), etc.You will not go wrong with the purchase, yes there are many advanced ANC's Headphones out there with improved technology however it's up to individual taste, needs, and how deep you can dig into your pockets.

These bad boys may look subtle but explicitly deliver what they say, i.e. ""Industry Leading Wireless Noise Cancellation"". Audio quality is top-notch with zero lags while playing music. The music is crisp and clear audio without compromising the bass. Tried them while at the gym and it instantly cuts out all other noise. However, since the headphone completely encircles and covers your ear, they will get wet in no time. Although it won't affect them in any way but will make you feel slightly uncomfortable.I believe these are best suited for those long journey trips where you just want to disconnect yourself from your surrounding and listen to your music/watch a movie.Again, ""if your budget allows you"" and you're a true audiophile, then look no further.",5.0,16 June 2023,0
