0,One of the best smartphones available as for 2024.,Placeholder,"Booked my 12+512gb version as soon as it was launched. And after using it for more than a month, here's my review.Pros1) exceptional camera quality. The 12MP ultra-wide does it's job and I would say going for 5x optical zoom with 50MP sensor instead for 10x 10MP sensor is a better choice as upto 30x I would say the pictures are more crisp than S23 ultra.2) Build quality is premium. It feels like a high budget smartphone. Not sure if titanium armor is enough to withstand high drop possibilities, but it does make it lighter.3) Screen is a big improvement. The anti reflective Corning Gorilla glass armor does it's job and reflects most of the glare so you can sit easily and watch without worrying if the person sitting next to you is watching coz they can't. üòÅ3) S-pen has improved a bit. A lot of people are saying that they don't use it much after first time, but that's not the case with me. If you will get the hang of it, you will use it quite often.4) AI interface is quite excellent. Although in initial phase, it does it's job in notes and summarising big pages so that you can easily get the gist.5) 7 years OS and security update is a big big up from my side.6) The box like built rather than a curve display is a better choice. It's easier to find a screen protector.7) sanpdragan 8 gen3 is fast. You can play high end games at maximum capacity. Android 14 with one UI 6 is smooth as you can hope it would be. I haven't recorded any lags or heating issues as for now.Cons1) Anti refective display works until you put  the above mention screen protector. After that it won't work with that precision. Although it still does it's job.2) Selfie camera is still not that great if you're using iPhone 14 or 15 pro.3) generative AI is not that great in calls and photo editing. Also, to pay for these services after 2025 is a big drawback from Samsung.4) Samsung is still not implementing faster charging protocols on their high and mid range smartphones. In a time when OnePlus is offering 100W charging speeds and xiomi offering 50-80W wireless charging, Samsung is still stuck with 45W and 15W wireless charging. Big drawback. However, battery do last for a full day.5) speaking of charging, no charger included is a serious letdown when you're spending more than a lac on a high end smartphone. Samsung, it doesn't feels good. üòîOverall, a good smartphone if you're thinking to go for a big one for a long time.",5.0,8 March 2024,170
1,Powerhouse s24 ultra,Ankita,"First of all i was a iphone 12 user i switched to s24ultra. i was looking for a upgrade in terms of camera software display. I had only two phones selected iphone 15 promax amd s24 ultra. S24u was costing me 80k with all offers whereas 15promx 1.26lakh  so went for s24uNow s24 using since 1monthAndroid 14 ui 6 is powerfulDisplay is awesome flat screen looks wonderfulProcessor is fastFingerprint sensor is goodCamera quality is great zoom portrait 3x 5x is very goodBattery gives 18hrs backup easily with 8-9 hrs of screentimeS pen is awesome making notes is so much funAI features are really helpful and it works flawlessly its something to experienceNot to likeWeight of the phoneTwo handed use since its a big phoneSize in pocket feels uncomfortable due to sharp cornersSecurity when compared to iphone is not great iphone is another level when comes to securityWeight and size made me rethink about my decision but now bit used to but still miss my iphone ease of use eg to take selfie its very cumbersome to use of Weight and sizeProfessional Summary:I recently transitioned from an iPhone 12 to the Samsung S24 Ultra, seeking an upgrade in terms of camera quality, software, and display. After careful consideration, I chose the S24 Ultra over the iPhone 15 Pro Max due to its more favorable price point.Observations after one month of usage:1. Android 14 UI 6: The user interface is robust and powerful, providing a seamless user experience.2. Display: The flat screen offers excellent visual quality and clarity.3. Processor: The device's processor delivers fast and efficient performance.4. Fingerprint Sensor: The fingerprint sensor functions effectively and reliably.5. Camera Quality: The camera system, particularly the zoom and portrait modes, produces impressive results.6. Battery Life: The battery provides exceptional longevity, supporting up to 18 hours of usage with extensive screen time.7. S Pen: The S Pen stylus enhances productivity and creativity, making note-taking and other tasks enjoyable.8. AI Features: The device's AI capabilities are highly effective and provide valuable assistance.Areas for Improvement:1. Weight: The weight of the phone can be cumbersome and may require two-handed usage.2. Size: The large size of the phone can be uncomfortable to carry in pockets due to its sharp corners.3. Security: Compared to the iPhone, the S24 Ultra's security features may be perceived as less robust.While the weight and size initially raised concerns, I have gradually adapted to these aspects. However, I occasionally miss the ease of use offered by my previous iPhone, particularly when taking selfies due to the weight and size constraints.Overall, the Samsung S24 Ultra offers a compelling combination of features and capabilities, making it a worthwhile upgrade for those seeking a powerful and versatile smartphone.",5.0,17 May 2024,4

The packaging was like that of a bar of soap, just a couple of thin layer of pop wrap. It was so beat up, that the delivery man couldnt belive me when i told him inside is one of the most expensive phones available.I opened it in front of him just in case.Amazon you have started to take your loyal cutomers for granted.

41,Sold my car to buy this,AJ,"What an amazing product.After seeing the glowing reviews, I had to go and experience this god send product in the Samsung store myself.After playing with it in the store, taking pics of other phones and strangers in the store, I fell in love.I sold my car the next day to get money for this as it was more viable over selling kidney or other organs. I also sold my only double bed, table and old phone to get the 512gb version because who needs SD cards.After buying it with cash (since I don't like taking loans) I was truly blown away. I now Uber everywhere or walk and take pictures on the way. Sometimes some may say that I look like a creep with the amazing zoom but who cares.

42,Prepurchase Opinions & Help,AG,"I own a Samsung S23. I love Samsung. I'm an avid fan of AI. There are only a few reasons I am not purchasing this phone, and you should consider them as well.1. Most of us will not use at least 20% of the features in everyday life. That has been the case with every phone I've ever purchased.2. It is ridiculous that a phone at this price doesn't include a charger. As classy as their phones are, that's a sleazy move on their part.3. Charging speeds? That is something most of us care about on a daily basis!4. Subscription payment plan? Download some free AI apps and you're done.5. If there was a global poll, I can guarantee you most people would not miss the pen. Therefore it's a somewhat and sometime useful addition since it's there. It's not a requirement. You know what is? A charger! üôÇThe S23 is an incredible phone, and I'm sure this one is too.I just realized I paid way too much for a phone. I realized I could have saved 40% of what I paid and donated it to some charity.Think before purchasing any phone, especially at this price. We can get over 95% of what we need in a smartphone for far less.",3.0,21 April 2024,6
43,A true flagship but s23ultra is better value,Rakshit Shetty,The phone ticks all the boxes but there is only incremental refinements since s22 ultra .The cameras are almost identical in s23ultra s22ultra and s24 ultra . I am barely noticing any major upgrade in cameras .They should have gone for a triple 200mp sensor for main 3x and 10x and that would have been a major upgrade since there is no space to have dual periscope cameras. Using sensor crop they would have been able to get optical quality till 10x and then till 40 x they could use sensor cropping ....With no perceptible upgrade in cameras it is a sort of a let down and s23ultra is more value for money ...Going for a 5x 50mp sensor is like going back to the s20 ultra days which had a 4x 48mp sensor .Pixel 7 pro xiomi 13 ultra etc all had this  5x 50 mp sensor camera tech since 1 to 3 years ago ....Other than that the phone is top of the line state of the art ...Was expecting 5500ma battery on the lines of Vivo x100pro who is the current camera king üëë...Samsung needs to get their act together and up the ante ...,4.0,15 March 2024,3

My go to favorite is circle to search and it's amazing tbh. Got used to it alot now.Battery life is sligthly on better side, not that great still I would say. My 22 ultra battery life used to suck after 2 years. Can only comment after long run use, but still it's a better than many other phones.Charing supports 45W fast charger, if you ask me comparison between 25W vs 45W charger you'll see only 10-15 mins difference max.So far so good.

62,Samsung is not trustworthy,Sreeraj N,"Samsung is a worst company in after services in my experience. I purchased a Galaxy A73 1.8 months before. After the software updating, I faced green line issues. I approached the authorised customer care centre at Calicut but their couldn‚Äôt consider the issue seriously and advised to change display with Rs.8500 /- I so many times contacted the customer care centre but there is no use. Finaly, I arranged Rs.8500/- and approached the company again but their increased the display amount to almost Rs.10000/- as a fraud and not trustworthy. The service centre is situated in a corner of the city, there is no proper buss Rute also and so difficult to travel. Service centre executives are not trained and responsible to handily the customer. They just register the complaint that so. Other companies are something better than Samsung I think. They are providing maximum benefit in low cost and better services but Samsung offering minimum benefit in maximum cost and irresponsible services. So, I will not suggest Samsung to my friends and familiesSreeraj NCalicut, Kerala, India",1.0,27 April 2024,28
63,S22Ultra User to S24 Ultra User Persistent Signal Issues,Abhishek Sinha,"One thing. Regret buying this too much of advertised device. You would be surprised to hear S22Ultra had IP68 rating and still dust entered my camera lens internally. On top of it I was always out of network. Heart said to goFor iPhone which is consistent but went for S24 Ultra. The problem I inherited from S22 Ultra is of signal. Usually there is no network or I loose network while on a call or connecting to laptop through Hotspot. I changed SIM cards, ported to other network but the problem persisted.Did a google review on this and looks like I am not the only user with this problem. All the Ultra series right from S22 to S 24 have this problem. I inserted the same Sim in a 15K phone Samsung A13 and I had no such problem. So for almost 1 lakh rupees after exchange I have a brick for their advertised stuff instead would have bought DSLR. I cannot return but will have to endure it for sometime. Hence Regret massive regret to purchase this device. The decision is upon you folks and your own personal experience.
