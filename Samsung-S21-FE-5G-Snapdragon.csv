0,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) Review: Lavender Dream with Power-Packed Performance,SHIWANI,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) in the stunning Lavender color variant, equipped with a Snapdragon 888 processor, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in many ways.Delivery Experience:Firstly, I was pleasantly surprised by the swift delivery process from Amazon. The product arrived even before the expected delivery date, ensuring a tension-free experience.Design and Color:The Lavender color portrayed on the website was precisely what I received. The device's sleek design and elegant color instantly caught my attention, adding a touch of sophistication to my tech collection.Performance:Powered by the Snapdragon 888 processor, this phone delivers lightning-fast performance. Apps open instantly, multitasking is seamless, and gaming is a joy with no lag whatsoever. The 8GB RAM ensures smooth operation even with multiple apps running simultaneously.Storage:With a spacious 256GB of internal storage, I have ample space to store all my photos, videos, and apps without worrying about running out of space.Value for Money:One of the highlights of my purchase was the significant discount I received, bringing the price down to a very reasonable 33,968.00. Coupled with additional credit card discounts, it was an offer too good to resist.Accessories:While the package did not include a charger or a back cover, it did come with a USB-C to USB-C cable. While this might be considered a disadvantage by some, it's worth noting that many users already have spare chargers and covers from previous devices. Nevertheless, it would have been a nice addition to include these accessories.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) in Lavender is a powerhouse of a smartphone that offers exceptional performance, ample storage, and a stunning design. Despite the minor drawback of missing accessories, the overall experience has been nothing short of excellent. I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a top-tier smartphone at a competitive price point.рдореИрдВрдиреЗ рд╣рд╛рд▓ рд╣реА рдореЗрдВ рд▓реИрд╡реЗрдВрдбрд░ рд░рдВрдЧ рдХреЗ рд╕реБрдВрджрд░ рд╡реЗрд░рд┐рдПрдВрдЯ рдореЗрдВ рд╕реИрдорд╕рдВрдЧ рдЧреИрд▓реЗрдХреНрд╕реА рдПрд╕21 рдПрдлрдИ 5рдЬреА (2023) рдХреЛ рдЦрд░реАрджрд╛, рдЬрд┐рд╕рдореЗрдВ рд╕реНрдиреИрдкрдбреНрд░реИрдЧрди 888 рдкреНрд░реЛрд╕реЗрд╕рд░ рд▓рдЧрд╛ рд╣реБрдЖ рд╣реИ, рдФрд░ рдореБрдЭреЗ рдХрд╣рдирд╛ рд╣реИ, рдпрд╣ рдХрдИ рддрд░реАрдХреЛрдВ рдореЗрдВ рдореЗрд░реА рдЙрдореНрдореАрджреЛрдВ рдХреЛ рдкрд╛рд░ рдХрд░ рдЧрдпрд╛ рд╣реИредрдбрд┐рд▓реАрд╡рд░реА рдЕрдиреБрднрд╡:рд╕рдмрд╕реЗ рдкрд╣рд▓реЗ, рдЕрдореЗрдЬрд╝рди рд╕реЗ рдзрд╛рд░рд╛ рдкреНрд░рдХреНрд░рд┐рдпрд╛ рдХреЗ рдорд╛рдзреНрдпрдо рд╕реЗ рдореБрдЭреЗ рддреЗрдЬреА рд╕реЗ рдбрд┐рд▓реАрд╡рд░реА рдХреА рдкреНрд░рдХреНрд░рд┐рдпрд╛ рд╕реЗ рдкреНрд░рд╕рдиреНрдирддрд╛ рдорд┐рд▓реАред рдЙрддреНрдкрд╛рдж рдиреЗ рдЕрдкреЗрдХреНрд╖рд┐рдд рдбрд┐рд▓реАрд╡рд░реА рддрд┐рдерд┐ рд╕реЗ рдкрд╣рд▓реЗ рд╣реА рдкрд╣реБрдВрдЪ рдЧрдпрд╛, рдЬрд┐рд╕рд╕реЗ рдПрдХ рддрдирд╛рд╡рдореБрдХреНрдд рдЕрдиреБрднрд╡ рд╕реБрдирд┐рд╢реНрдЪрд┐рдд рд╣реБрдЖредрдбрд┐рдЬрд╝рд╛рдЗрди рдФрд░ рд░рдВрдЧ:рд╡реЗрдмрд╕рд╛рдЗрдЯ рдкрд░ рдкреНрд░рджрд░реНрд╢рд┐рдд рд▓реИрд╡реЗрдВрдбрд░ рд░рдВрдЧ рдкреНрд░рд╛рдкреНрдд рдХрд┐рдпрд╛ рдЧрдпрд╛ рдерд╛ред рдЙрдкрдХрд░рдг рдХрд╛ рд╕реНрд▓реАрдХ рдбрд┐рдЬрд╝рд╛рдЗрди рдФрд░ рд╢рд╛рдирджрд╛рд░ рд░рдВрдЧ рдореЗрд░реЗ рдзреНрдпрд╛рди рдХреЛ рддреБрд░рдВрдд рдЖрдХрд░реНрд╖рд┐рдд рдХрд┐рдпрд╛, рдореЗрд░реЗ рдЯреЗрдХ рд╕рдВрдЧреНрд░рд╣ рдХреЛ рдПрдХ рд╢реИрд▓реА рдХреА рдЫреВрдЯ рджреЗрддреЗ рд╣реБрдПредрдкреНрд░рджрд░реНрд╢рди:рд╕реНрдиреИрдкрдбреНрд░реИрдЧрди 888 рдкреНрд░реЛрд╕реЗрд╕рд░ рджреНрд╡рд╛рд░рд╛ рд╕рдВрдЪрд╛рд▓рд┐рдд, рдпрд╣ рдлреЛрди рддреЗрдЬрд╝ рдкреНрд░рджрд░реНрд╢рди рдкреНрд░рджрд╛рди рдХрд░рддрд╛ рд╣реИред рдПрдкреНрд▓рд┐рдХреЗрд╢рди рддреБрд░рдВрдд рдЦреБрд▓рддреЗ рд╣реИрдВ, рдорд▓реНрдЯреАрдЯрд╛рд╕реНрдХрд┐рдВрдЧ рд╕рд╣рдЬ рд╣реИ, рдФрд░ рдЧреЗрдорд┐рдВрдЧ рдореЗрдВ рдХреЛрдИ рд▓реИрдЧ рдирд╣реАрдВ рд╣реИред 8рдЬреАрдмреА рд░реИрдо рд╕реЗ рднреА рдХрдИ рдПрдкреНрд╕ рд╕рд╛рде рдореЗрдВ рдЪрд▓рдиреЗ рдкрд░ рднреА рд╕реНрдореВрде рдСрдкрд░реЗрд╢рди рд╕реБрдирд┐рд╢реНрдЪрд┐рдд рд╣реЛрддрд╛ рд╣реИредрд╕рдВрдЧреНрд░рд╣рдг:рдЕрдВрддрд░реНрдирд┐рд╣рд┐рдд рд╕реНрдЯреЛрд░реЗрдЬ рдХреЗ 256рдЬреАрдмреА рдХреЗ рд╕рд╛рде, рдореЗрд░реЗ рдкрд╛рд╕ рд╕рднреА рддрд╕реНрд╡реАрд░реЗрдВ, рд╡реАрдбрд┐рдпреЛ рдФрд░ рдПрдкреНрд▓рд┐рдХреЗрд╢рди рд╕реНрдЯреЛрд░ рдХрд░рдиреЗ рдХреЗ рд▓рд┐рдП рдкрд░реНрдпрд╛рдкреНрдд рдЬрдЧрд╣ рд╣реИ рдФрд░ рд╕реНрдЯреЛрд░реЗрдЬ рдХреА рдХрдореА рдХрд╛ рдбрд░ рдирд╣реАрдВ рд╣реИредрдореВрд▓реНрдп рдХреЗ рд▓рд┐рдП:рдореЗрд░реА рдЦрд░реАрдж рдХреА рдПрдХ рдмрдбрд╝реА рдЫреВрдЯ рдХреЗ рд╕рд╛рде, рдореВрд▓реНрдп рдХреЛ рдПрдХ рдмрд╣реБрдд рд╣реА рдЙрдЪрд┐рдд 33,968.00 рдкрд░ рд▓реЗ рдЖрдпрд╛ рдЧрдпрд╛ рдерд╛ред рдЕрддрд┐рд░рд┐рдХреНрдд рдХреНрд░реЗрдбрд┐рдЯ рдХрд╛рд░реНрдб рдЫреВрдЯреЛрдВ рдХреЗ рд╕рд╛рде, рдпрд╣ рдПрдХ рдмреЗрд╣рдж рдЕрдЪреНрдЫрд╛ рдкреНрд░рд╕реНрддрд╛рд╡ рдерд╛редрд╕рд╣рд╛рдпрдХ рдЙрдкрдХрд░рдг:рд╣рд╛рд▓рд╛рдВрдХрд┐ рдкреИрдХреЗрдЬ рдореЗрдВ рдЪрд╛рд░реНрдЬрд░ рдпрд╛ рдкреАрдЫреЗ рдХрд╛ рдХрд╡рд░ рд╢рд╛рдорд┐рд▓ рдирд╣реАрдВ рдерд╛, рд▓реЗрдХрд┐рди рдпрд╣ рдПрдХ USB-C рд╕реЗ USB-C рдХреЗрдмрд▓ рдХреЗ рд╕рд╛рде рдЖрдпрд╛ рдерд╛ред рдпрд╣ рдХреБрдЫ рд▓реЛрдЧреЛрдВ рджреНрд╡рд╛рд░рд╛ рдПрдХ рдХрдореА рдХреЗ рд░реВрдк рдореЗрдВ рд╡рд┐рдЪрд╛рд░ рдХрд┐рдпрд╛ рдЬрд╛ рд╕рдХрддрд╛ рд╣реИ, рд▓реЗрдХрд┐рди рдзреНрдпрд╛рди рджреЗрдиреЗ рдпреЛрдЧреНрдп рд╣реИ рдХрд┐ рдмрд╣реБрдд рд╕реЗ рдЙрдкрдпреЛрдЧрдХрд░реНрддрд╛ рдкрд╣рд▓реЗ рдХреЗ рдЙрдкрдХрд░рдгреЛрдВ рд╕реЗ рдкрд░реНрдпрд╛рдкреНрдд рдЪрд╛рд░реНрдЬрд░ рдФрд░ рдХрд╡рд░ рд░рдЦрддреЗ рд╣реИрдВред рдлрд┐рд░ рднреА, рдпрд╣ рдпрд╣ рдЙрдкрдХрд░рдг рд╢рд╛рдорд┐рд▓ рдХрд░рдирд╛ рдЕрдЪреНрдЫрд╛ рд╣реЛрддрд╛ рдХрд┐ рдпреЗ рдЕрддрд┐рд░рд┐рдХреНрдд рдЙрдкрдХрд░рдгреЛрдВ рдХреЛ рд╢рд╛рдорд┐рд▓ рдХрд░рдирд╛ рдерд╛редрдХреБрд▓ рдорд┐рд▓рд╛рдХрд░, рд╕реИрдорд╕рдВрдЧ рдЧреИрд▓реЗрдХреНрд╕реА рдПрд╕21 рдПрдлрдИ 5рдЬреА (2023) рд▓реИрд╡реЗрдВрдбрд░ рд░рдВрдЧ рдореЗрдВ рдПрдХ рдкрд╛рд╡рд░рд╣рд╛рдЙрд╕ рд╕реНрдорд╛рд░реНрдЯрдлреЛрди рд╣реИ рдЬреЛ рдЙрддреНрдХреГрд╖реНрдЯ рдкреНрд░рджрд░реНрд╢рди, рд╡реНрдпрд╛рдкрдХ рд╕рдВрдЧреНрд░рд╣рдг рдФрд░ рд╢рд╛рдирджрд╛рд░ рдбрд┐рдЬрд╝рд╛рдЗрди рдкреНрд░рджрд╛рди рдХрд░рддрд╛ рд╣реИред рдЫреЛрдЯреЗ рдЙрд▓рдЭрди рдХрд╛ рдиреБрдХрд╕рд╛рди рдЫреЛрдбрд╝рдХрд░, рдХреБрд▓ рдЕрдиреБрднрд╡ рдЕрддреНрдпрдВрдд рдЙрддреНрдХреГрд╖реНрдЯ рд░рд╣рд╛ рд╣реИред рдореИрдВ рдЗрд╕реЗ рдЙрди рд╕рднреА рд▓реЛрдЧреЛрдВ рдХреЛ рдЕрдзрд┐рдХрддрдо рдореВрд▓реНрдп рдХреЗ рд▓рд┐рдП рд╢реАрд░реНрд╖ рд╕реНрдорд╛рд░реНрдЯрдлреЛрди рдХреЗ рд▓рд┐рдП рд╕рд░рд╛рд╣рдирд╛ рдХрд░реВрдБрдЧрд╛ рдЬреЛ рдПрдХ рдкреНрд░рддрд┐рд╕реНрдкрд░реНрдзреА рдореВрд▓реНрдп рд╕реНрддрд░ рдкрд░ рд╢реАрд░реНрд╖ рд╕реНрдорд╛рд░реНрдЯрдлреЛрди рдХреА рдЦреЛрдЬ рдореЗрдВ рд╣реИрдВред",5.0,14 February 2024,18

I can't tell you guys, I'm the first user in the house after redmi phones, I needed a change and wanted to explore more in other brands, I always had an eye for Samsung phones but was concerned whether to buy one or not. And today finally I got this beautiful piece, people who love camera is the best phone for them, but I disliked only two things about it,its that the charge is very slow and has heating issues but in every phone it is, so I liked it actually overall it's very good product, you can go for it!

I had OnePlus One(died), then Samsung S7(still working), OnePlus 7t(sudden death after 3 years)and now S21 FE.The overall quality of the phone is great apart from back plastic.The UI and overall experience of the phone is great as compared to OnePlus as it has custom Samsung tweaks everywhere (it was there in S7 as well with obviously little less features and refinement), which makes actually sense and makes you feel wow. Haptic is also great while typing ( but only X axis). But feel it's average in other use cases. One thing which personally do not like is the Samsung custom apps.The Camera is hands down the best in class. (But glare is bad, I am a photographer and that is the only reason you don't see the glare in the night shot)Only deal breaker is see is the battery optimisation. It is real, like global warming.Apart from it, this is a great phone.Let's see if can optimise it further.Note: There is a pixel less area sorrounding the front camera. Be careful if you are also  observant.",4.0,25 November 2023,28
