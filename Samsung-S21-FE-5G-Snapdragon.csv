0,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) Review: Lavender Dream with Power-Packed Performance,SHIWANI,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) in the stunning Lavender color variant, equipped with a Snapdragon 888 processor, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in many ways.Delivery Experience:Firstly, I was pleasantly surprised by the swift delivery process from Amazon. The product arrived even before the expected delivery date, ensuring a tension-free experience.Design and Color:The Lavender color portrayed on the website was precisely what I received. The device's sleek design and elegant color instantly caught my attention, adding a touch of sophistication to my tech collection.Performance:Powered by the Snapdragon 888 processor, this phone delivers lightning-fast performance. Apps open instantly, multitasking is seamless, and gaming is a joy with no lag whatsoever. The 8GB RAM ensures smooth operation even with multiple apps running simultaneously.Storage:With a spacious 256GB of internal storage, I have ample space to store all my photos, videos, and apps without worrying about running out of space.Value for Money:One of the highlights of my purchase was the significant discount I received, bringing the price down to a very reasonable 33,968.00. Coupled with additional credit card discounts, it was an offer too good to resist.Accessories:While the package did not include a charger or a back cover, it did come with a USB-C to USB-C cable. While this might be considered a disadvantage by some, it's worth noting that many users already have spare chargers and covers from previous devices. Nevertheless, it would have been a nice addition to include these accessories.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) in Lavender is a powerhouse of a smartphone that offers exceptional performance, ample storage, and a stunning design. Despite the minor drawback of missing accessories, the overall experience has been nothing short of excellent. I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a top-tier smartphone at a competitive price point.मैंने हाल ही में लैवेंडर रंग के सुंदर वेरिएंट में सैमसंग गैलेक्सी एस21 एफई 5जी (2023) को खरीदा, जिसमें स्नैपड्रैगन 888 प्रोसेसर लगा हुआ है, और मुझे कहना है, यह कई तरीकों में मेरी उम्मीदों को पार कर गया है।डिलीवरी अनुभव:सबसे पहले, अमेज़न से धारा प्रक्रिया के माध्यम से मुझे तेजी से डिलीवरी की प्रक्रिया से प्रसन्नता मिली। उत्पाद ने अपेक्षित डिलीवरी तिथि से पहले ही पहुंच गया, जिससे एक तनावमुक्त अनुभव सुनिश्चित हुआ।डिज़ाइन और रंग:वेबसाइट पर प्रदर्शित लैवेंडर रंग प्राप्त किया गया था। उपकरण का स्लीक डिज़ाइन और शानदार रंग मेरे ध्यान को तुरंत आकर्षित किया, मेरे टेक संग्रह को एक शैली की छूट देते हुए।प्रदर्शन:स्नैपड्रैगन 888 प्रोसेसर द्वारा संचालित, यह फोन तेज़ प्रदर्शन प्रदान करता है। एप्लिकेशन तुरंत खुलते हैं, मल्टीटास्किंग सहज है, और गेमिंग में कोई लैग नहीं है। 8जीबी रैम से भी कई एप्स साथ में चलने पर भी स्मूथ ऑपरेशन सुनिश्चित होता है।संग्रहण:अंतर्निहित स्टोरेज के 256जीबी के साथ, मेरे पास सभी तस्वीरें, वीडियो और एप्लिकेशन स्टोर करने के लिए पर्याप्त जगह है और स्टोरेज की कमी का डर नहीं है।मूल्य के लिए:मेरी खरीद की एक बड़ी छूट के साथ, मूल्य को एक बहुत ही उचित 33,968.00 पर ले आया गया था। अतिरिक्त क्रेडिट कार्ड छूटों के साथ, यह एक बेहद अच्छा प्रस्ताव था।सहायक उपकरण:हालांकि पैकेज में चार्जर या पीछे का कवर शामिल नहीं था, लेकिन यह एक USB-C से USB-C केबल के साथ आया था। यह कुछ लोगों द्वारा एक कमी के रूप में विचार किया जा सकता है, लेकिन ध्यान देने योग्य है कि बहुत से उपयोगकर्ता पहले के उपकरणों से पर्याप्त चार्जर और कवर रखते हैं। फिर भी, यह यह उपकरण शामिल करना अच्छा होता कि ये अतिरिक्त उपकरणों को शामिल करना था।कुल मिलाकर, सैमसंग गैलेक्सी एस21 एफई 5जी (2023) लैवेंडर रंग में एक पावरहाउस स्मार्टफोन है जो उत्कृष्ट प्रदर्शन, व्यापक संग्रहण और शानदार डिज़ाइन प्रदान करता है। छोटे उलझन का नुकसान छोड़कर, कुल अनुभव अत्यंत उत्कृष्ट रहा है। मैं इसे उन सभी लोगों को अधिकतम मूल्य के लिए शीर्ष स्मार्टफोन के लिए सराहना करूँगा जो एक प्रतिस्पर्धी मूल्य स्तर पर शीर्ष स्मार्टफोन की खोज में हैं।",5.0,14 February 2024,18

I can't tell you guys, I'm the first user in the house after redmi phones, I needed a change and wanted to explore more in other brands, I always had an eye for Samsung phones but was concerned whether to buy one or not. And today finally I got this beautiful piece, people who love camera is the best phone for them, but I disliked only two things about it,its that the charge is very slow and has heating issues but in every phone it is, so I liked it actually overall it's very good product, you can go for it!

I had OnePlus One(died), then Samsung S7(still working), OnePlus 7t(sudden death after 3 years)and now S21 FE.The overall quality of the phone is great apart from back plastic.The UI and overall experience of the phone is great as compared to OnePlus as it has custom Samsung tweaks everywhere (it was there in S7 as well with obviously little less features and refinement), which makes actually sense and makes you feel wow. Haptic is also great while typing ( but only X axis). But feel it's average in other use cases. One thing which personally do not like is the Samsung custom apps.The Camera is hands down the best in class. (But glare is bad, I am a photographer and that is the only reason you don't see the glare in the night shot)Only deal breaker is see is the battery optimisation. It is real, like global warming.Apart from it, this is a great phone.Let's see if can optimise it further.Note: There is a pixel less area sorrounding the front camera. Be careful if you are also  observant.",4.0,25 November 2023,28
