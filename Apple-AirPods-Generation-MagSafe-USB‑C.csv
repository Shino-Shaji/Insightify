0,AirPod Pro - 2nd Gen ü§ôü§ôü§ô,Sandy Cariappa,"Here‚Äôs my POV post  -1 month of usePros- Lightest ear buds out there- Seamless integration into your Apple products- Solid battery backup, gets me easily 2 days of run with full charge of the pods and the case- Fits excellently into your ear, and stays secure there. Do check the ear for rest for the right fit for the right seal- Wide range of accessories are available to customize your AirPods- Great set of in ear wireless buds for all occasions - work, while travelling, speaking to your circleANC and Spatial Audio- The best ANC in the market. I also have the Sony 1000XM5, and these pods are in a different league of their own- Spatial Audio with head tracking is just milestones away from the industry.- The sound experience is just phenomenal. Watch a title in Netflix or Prime title enabled with Spatial Audio and I seriously doubt if you have experienced anything better until now- Transparency mode is soo clear that you can hear yourself so clearly, and it‚Äôs not synthetic sound- Adaptive sound, this is available in 1000XM5, but not as excellent as the AirPods. The automated reduction of volume and increase when you stop speaking happens soo seamlessly- Personalization for your ear, there are a few options for you to do this, so that the buds give you the right outputs, and yes this is customized for you only- Apple Music, been using these bus with this app and the selection of choons with Spatial Audio are a must try - with head tracking enabled you get to immerse with high quality audio that you feel is playing right on your nose üòÄüòÄ- Software experience 5/5 compared to what‚Äôs out there in the market. Have tried the Sonys, Jabras but IOS17 just does magic for your UXOverall a brilliant product if you are in the Apple eco system. Haven‚Äôt tried this with an android but did connect this to my windows laptop, and it was a flat experience,General experience- My Apple warranty showed only 10 months of support and I panicked.- Went into the Apples check your devises coverage website and searched for the serial number- The website prompted that my purchase was not validated ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è thought I received a fake product (sorry Amazon, you know how many fakes are out there that start from 500 to 10000)- Logged into the website with my Apple ID and  validated my purchase date in Amazon and poof! 12 months warrant was instantly enabled- I am one happy customer!Finally sorry about the pics which had the case added, but you definitely need one case if you are buying one of these bad boys.Will keep this thread updated in case anything new pops up.",5.0,6 December 2023,68

2,Lives up to its name,Placeholder,"AirPods Pro 2, definitely lives to its name, with pro features. No doubt it‚Äôs the best your iPhone can have. The connectivity is seamless. The Spatial Audio feature is next level.As for value for money, I got it at a good price during the Summer Sale.PS- Don‚Äôt forget to get a good cleaning kit and a sturdy case for better protection.",5.0,10 May 2024,0
3,"Good product, but a bit expensive",N S.,"Good product from Apple, however, a bit on the expensive side. Price was reduced during Big Summer Sale (two days later).",4.0,10 May 2024,0
4,Made for the Apple ecosystem,Siva M,"Excellent audio quality esp. with an Apple product. Spatial Audio is extraordinary; try with any Spatial Audio track on Apple Music and you will be amazed (I didn‚Äôt try with any other Dolby Atmos streams). It has all the advertised features (head tracking, etc), more so, if used with Apple sound sources. Battery life is just ok and it comes for around six hours with Dolby Atmos playback; it may be more with normal music though. I found the battery to be draining faster when used with online meetings on PC or on phones.It pairs fine with Android phones and Windows 11 devices and can use basic features like any other Bluetooth earbuds.",5.0,30 April 2024,0
5,It‚Äôs a scam,Rupesh,Please never ever buy this product from the seller it is scam. as shown in the picture the seal from apple is broken later the seal is made with normal plastic I would suggest not to take a chance by ordering this but luckily the amazon customer service helped me in returning the order but please don‚Äôt take a chance to buy this online,1.0,14 May 2024,0

6,"AirPods pro gen 2: Better Sound, More Comfort, Perfect for Apple Fans",John annish,"The AirPods Pro Gen 2 are really good for enjoying music and other sounds because they make you feel like you're right in the middle of it all. They're comfy to wear and easy to use, which is great for everyone, whether you're really into music or just use earbuds every day. They sound better than before, block out outside noise, and look cool, too. But they cost a lot and might not work with every device, so they're best for people who already use a lot of Apple stuff.",4.0,9 May 2024,0
